# Learning php and MySql

Hi,

I am learning php and MySQL! I am using this book: [PHP & MySQL: Novice to Ninja, 6th Edition](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/php-mysql-novice-to-ninja-6th-edition/read/1), by Tom Butler, Kevin Yank.

Sharing this code with anyone who would enjoy helping me out to become a better dev! I am also always open to study friends!
